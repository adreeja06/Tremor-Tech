# Tremor-Tech
TremorTech is a non-invasive smart wearable designed to help people with Parkinsonâ€™s Disease manage tremors and muscle stiffness.   By combining **EMG &amp; GSR sensors** with **vibrotactile stimulation**, the device detects abnormal neural activity in real time and responds with targeted vibrations to reduce tremors.
