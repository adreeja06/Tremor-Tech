## 📌 Problem Background  

Parkinson’s Disease is a **chronic neurodegenerative disorder** that progressively limits daily activities, especially in the elderly.  

### 🌍 Key Facts
- Cases have **doubled globally** in the last 25 years  
- Over **8.5 million people** were affected as of 2019  
- **5.8 million DALYs** lost due to PD every year  
- Causes: genetics (15%) and environmental toxins  

### 🩺 Major Symptoms
- Uncontrollable tremors  
- Muscle rigidity & slowness  
- Impaired balance & posture  
- Freezing of movement (↑ risk of falls)  

👉 In India, nearly **7 million elderly citizens** are living with PD.  
There is an urgent need for **low-cost, safe, and effective assistive solutions**.

## 🚀 Our Solution — TremorTech  

A **lightweight smart band** that continuously monitors tremor activity using:  
- **EMG (Electromyography)** sensors  
- **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)** sensors  

Once tremors are detected, the system instantly delivers **haptic vibrations** that counteract abnormal signals, reducing shaking and restoring smoother movement.

## 🌟 Highlights & Benefits  

- **Non-invasive** — no surgery or medicines required  
- **Therapeutic vibrations** — personalized for tremor relief  
- **Compact design** — comfortable, wearable like a wristband  
- **Quick setup** — one-time calibration for the user  
- **IoT support** — cloud data sharing for doctors & family  
- **Affordable care** — cost-effective vs. conventional therapies  

---

## 🎯 Unique Edge  

- **Real-time neuromodulation** — breaks tremor cycles instantly  
- **Accessibility-first** — designed for seniors and caregivers  
- **Drug-free** — eliminates side effects of medication  
- **Clinically relevant** — built on proven biomedical insights

## 🔬 Working Principle  

1. **Sensor input** → EMG & GSR track tremor signals  
2. **Processing unit** → Arduino Nano interprets data  
3. **Actuator response** → vibration motors stimulate muscles  
4. **Effect** → tremors are calmed, mobility improves
